# Hele

Hele is a platform agnostic system cleaner, able to locate and terminate most common botnets, trojans and viruses. Using intelligent AI and machine learning algorithms, this can even detect custom builds (ZeuS, Citadel, BYOB, BYOT) that are invisible through abstraction and operate at low level.

This software is compatible with multiple modern architectures such as ARM, x86, RISC microcontrollers, and so on, but requires a standard, x86 PC host of capable power.

This software is in active development, please contact for a key.

We only accept payment in Bitcoin, with multiple packages available, both as a rolling contract and a temporary access for beta testing in your application.

## Getting Started

Compiling occurs by supplying the serial provided upon purchase of a license, which allows you to make a custom build with the components you require.

Via the root, at the index, the following commands are available:

- /device
 This command is followed by the device class, being one of:
  - Phone
  - Smart Watch
  - Storage
  - Computer
  - Microcontroller Embedded
  
- /r
 This command controls whether scan is recursive or only top level in dir provided
 
- /dir
 This command is followed by the directory, relative to installation directory.
 
### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Intel i7
 - Minimum 6 cores, 4GHz, and with support for AVX / SSE4.2 THROUGHPUT OR ELSE FALLBACK TO VIRTUALISATION - HEAVY SYS TOLL!
 
 GTX 1080Ti
 - Heavy graphic acceleration is in use to simulate multiple dimension models, particularly for multiplatform infections across more than one architecture, due to realtime compilation and abstraction.
 
 SSD (PCIe Preferred)
 Hele makes heavy use of real time caching as signatures are generated of files, and hence fast read writes of minimum 500Mbps and ability to maintain fast, rapid IO is cruical in preventing slowdown and traffic management as files cannot be processed fast enough.
