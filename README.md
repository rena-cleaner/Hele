# Hele

Hele is a platform agnostic system cleaner, able to locate and terminate most common botnets, trojans and viruses. Using intelligent AI and machine learning algorithms, this can even detect custom builds (ZeuS, Citadel, BYOB, BYOT) that are invisible through abstraction and operate at low level.

This software is compatible with multiple modern architectures such as ARM, x86, RISC microcontrollers, and so on, but requires a standard, x86 PC host of capable power.

## Getting Started

Compiling occurs by supplying the serial provided upon purchase of a license, which allows you to make a custom build with the components you require.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Intel i7
 - Minimum 6 cores, 4GHz, and with support for AVX / SSE4.2 THROUGHPUT OR ELSE FALLBACK TO VIRTUALISATION - HEAVY SYS TOLL!
 
 GTX 1080Ti
 - Heavy graphic acceleration is in use to simulate multiple dimension models, particularly for multiplatform infections across more than one architecture, due to realtime compilation and abstraction.
```
